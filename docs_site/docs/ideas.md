Strategies are developed through a rigorous top-down macroeconomic framework integrated with bottom-up fundamental analysis 
and extensive use of quantitative methods to identify high-conviction opportunities across asset classes, geographies, durations, sectors,
industries, and risk factors.

Long/Short portfolios are structured with a long volatility targeting approach and are designed to deliver defined risk exposure and asymmetric return
profiles. Risk management is embedded at every stage of the portfolio management process, with capital preservation and downside protection 
prioritised as core principles.


Here's some inline math: $E = mc^2$.

And here's a block:

$$
\min_{\mathbf{w}} \mathbf{w}^\top \Sigma \mathbf{w}
$$

Here's some inline math: $E = \text{mc}^2$.

$E = \mathrm{mc}^2$

Bad: $E = mc^2$

Better: $E = \mathrm{mc}^2$

Best: $E = \text{mc}^2$

$E = \text{mc}^2$ ✅

$E = \text{mc}^2$ ✅

$E = \mathrm{mc}^2$ ✅

$E = mc^2$ ❌ (avoid)
